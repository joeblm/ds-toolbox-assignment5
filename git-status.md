Definition: git status
This command is useful to get information on the branch you are currently on and its status vs the remote branch.
It also shows if there are staged changes, unstaged changes, and whether untracked files exist.

You can access the same information in Jupyter Lab by looking at the sidebar and clicking on the "Git" icon. 
There the current branch will be shown, and staging status can be seen under the "Changes" tab
